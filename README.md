# learning
This repo contains all the code I wrote for courses I followed. You are welcome to look at the code and use it in your own solution, as long as you do not copy and paste directly. Learning is a skill that is only learned by doing, not copying.

I am aware of the fact that some of this code could use improvement, but it might be a dated project or I might not have seen a better way to do it, when I originally wrote it. Sometimes I update the code, that I deem outdated or unfit - but most of the time, I just keep the code as it was when I took the course.

If you have any questions about the assignments or the code written, you are probably most likely to reach me via either the courses Discord or Reddit, where I go by /u/HalfBalcony.
